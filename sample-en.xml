* '''Love — caritas — is an extraordinary force which leads people to opt for courageous and generous engagement in the field of justice and peace.''' It is a force that has its origin in God, Eternal Love and Absolute Truth. Each person finds his good by adherence to God's plan for him, in order to realize it fully: in this plan, he finds his truth, and through adherence to this truth he becomes free (cf. Jn 8:32). '''To defend the truth, to articulate it with humility and conviction, and to bear witness to it in life are''' therefore '''exacting and indispensable forms of charity. Charity, in fact, “rejoices in the truth” (1 Cor 13:6).'''
** [[Pope Benedict XVI]], in Encyclical Letter ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20090629_caritas-in-veritate_en.html Caritas in Veritate]'' (29 June 2009)

* '''Only in truth does charity shine forth, only in truth can charity be authentically lived. Truth is the light that gives meaning and value to charity. That light is both the light of reason and the light of faith, through which the intellect attains to the natural and supernatural truth of charity: it grasps its meaning as gift, acceptance, and communion. Without truth, charity degenerates into sentimentality. Love becomes an empty shell, to be filled in an arbitrary way. In a culture without truth, this is the fatal risk facing love. It falls prey to contingent subjective emotions and opinions, the word “love” is abused and distorted, to the point where it comes to mean the opposite. Truth frees charity from the constraints of an emotionalism that deprives it of relational and social content, and of a fideism that deprives it of human and universal breathing-space.'''
** [[Pope Benedict XVI]], in Encyclical Letter ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20090629_caritas-in-veritate_en.html Caritas in Veritate]'' (29 June 2009)

* '''Authentic love is obviously something good. When we love we become most fully human. But people often consider themselves loving when actually they are possessive or manipulative. People sometimes treat others as objects to satisfy their own needs.''' How easy it is to be deceived by the many voices in our society that advocate a permissive approach to sexuality, without regard for modesty, self-respect or the moral values that bring quality into human relationships! This is worship of a false god; instead of bringing life, it brings death.

* '''Love has a particular trait: it has a task or purpose to fulfill - to abide. By its nature, love is enduring.''' The Holy Spirit offers our world love that dispels uncertainty; love that overcomes the fear of betrayal; love that carries eternity within; the true love that draws us into a unity that abides!

* '''Dear young people''', we have seen that it is the Holy Spirit who brings about the wonderful communion of believers in Jesus Christ.

** [[Pope Benedict XVI]], Youth Day Vigil (19 July 2007) at World Youth Day 2008 in Australia

* A new generation of Christians is being called to help build a world in which God's gift of life is welcomed, respected and cherished-not rejected, feared as a threat and destroyed. A new age in which '''love is not greedy or self-seeking, but pure, faithful and genuinely free, open to others, respectful of their dignity, seeking their good, radiating joy and beauty''' - a new age in which hope liberates us from the shallowness, apathy and self-absorption that deaden our souls and poison our relationships.

** Professional standards, the standards of ambition and selfishness, are always sliding downward toward expense, ostentation, and mediocrity. They tend always to narrow the ground of judgment. But amateur standards, '''the standards of love, are always straining upward toward the humble and the best. They enlarge the ground of judgment. The context of love is the world.'''

* '''The gods throw the dice, and they don't ask whether we want to be in the game or not.''' They don't care if when you go, you leave behind a lover, a home, a career, or a dream. The gods don't care whether you have it all, whether it seems that your every desire can be met through hard work and persistence. The gods don't want to know about your plans and your hopes. Somewhere they're throwing the dice — and you are chosen. From then on, winning or losing is only a question of luck. &lt;br&gt; '''The gods throw the dice, freeing love from its cage.

* '''Love is always new. Regardless of whether we love once, twice, or a dozen times in our life, we always face a brand-new situation. Love can consign us to hell or to paradise, but it always takes us somewhere.''' We simply have to accept it, because it is what nourishes our existence. If we reject it, we die of hunger, because we lack the courage to reach out a hand and pluck the fruit from the branches of the tree of life. '''We have to take love where we find it, even if it means hours, days, weeks of disappointment and sadness. &lt;br&gt; The moment we begin to seek love, love begins to seek us. &lt;br&gt; And to save us.'''

** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept|By The River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept]]'' (1994)

* '''I am going to sit here with you by the river. If you go home to sleep, I will sleep in front of your house. And if you go away, I will follow you — until you tell me to go away. Then I'll leave. But I have to love you for the rest of my life.'''
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept|By The River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept]]'' (1994)
* Love is much like a dam: if you allow a tiny crack to form through which only a trickle of water can pass, that trickle will quickly bring down the whole structure, and soon no one will be able to control the force of the current. For when those walls come down, then love takes over, and it no longer matters what is possible or impossible; it doesn't even matter whether we can keep the loved one at our side. '''To love is to lose control.'''
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept|By The River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept]]'' (1994)

* '''When we meet someone and fall in love, we have a sense that the whole universe is on our side. And yet if something goes wrong, there is nothing left!''' How is it possible for the beauty that was there only minutes before to vanish so quickly? '''Life moves very fast. It rushes from heaven to hell in a matter of seconds.'''
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Eleven Minutes|Eleven Minutes]]'' (2003), page 9

* '''My aim is to understand love.''' I know how alive I felt when I was in love, and I know that everything I have now, however interesting it might seem, doesn't really excited me. &lt;br&gt; But love is a terrible thing: I've seen my girlfriends suffer and I don't want the same thing to happen to me. ... Although my aim is to understand love, and although I suffer to think of people to whom I gave my heart, I see that those who touched my heart failed to arouse my body, and that those who aroused my body failed to touch my heart.
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Eleven Minutes|Eleven Minutes]]'' (2003), Maria's diary entry at the age of 17, p. 16

* '''In love, no one can harm anyone else; we are each of us responsible for our own feelings and cannot blame someone else for what we feel.''' It hurt when I lost each of the various men I fell in love with. Now, though, I am convinced that no one loses anyone, because no one owns anyone. '''That is the true experience of freedom: having the most important thing in the world without owning it.'''
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Eleven Minutes|Eleven Minutes]]'' (2003), p. 90

* '''Anyone who is in love is making love the whole time, even when they're not.''' When two bodies meet, it is just the cup overflowing. They can stay together for hours, even days. They begin the dance one day and finish it the next, or — such is the pleasure they experience — they may never finish it. No eleven minutes for them.
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Eleven Minutes|Eleven Minutes]]'' (2003), p. 164

* '''Love simply is.''' That is the testament of Athena or Sherine or Hagia Sofia — '''love is.''' No definitions. '''Love and don't ask too many questions. Just love.'''
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:The Witch of Portobello|The Witch of Portobello]]'' (2007), p. 258

* The light of love flows out of my soul, but it can go nowhere because it’s blocked by pain. I could inhale and exhale every morning for the rest of my life, but that wouldn’t solve anything.
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Aleph|Aleph]]'' (2011)

* '''No one can learn to love by following a manual, and no one can learn to write by following a course.''' I’m not telling you to seek out other writers but to find people with different skills from yourself, '''because writing is no different from any other activity done with joy and enthusiasm.'''

* '''Love is the only thing that will save us, independent of any mistakes we may make. Love is always stronger.'''

* '''Love always triumphs over what we call death. That’s why there’s no need to grieve for our loved ones, because they continue to be loved and remain by our side.'''
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Aleph|Aleph]]'' (2011)

* '''I love you like a river that creates the right conditions for trees and bushes and flowers to flourish along its banks. I love you like a river that gives water to the thirsty and takes people where they want to go.'''
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Aleph|Aleph]]'' (2011)

* I love you like a river that understands that it must learn to flow differently over waterfalls and to rest in the shallows. I love you because we are all born in the same place, at the same source, which keeps us provided with a constant supply of water. And so, when we feel weak, all we have to do is wait a little. The spring returns, and the winter snows melt and fill us with new energy.
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Aleph|Aleph]]'' (2011)

* I love you like a river that begins as a solitary trickle in the mountains and gradually grows and joins other rivers until, after a certain point, it can flow around any obstacle in order to get where it wants.
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Aleph|Aleph]]'' (2011)

* '''I receive your love, and I give you mine.''' Not the love of a man for a woman, not the love of a father for a child, not the love of God for his creatures, but '''a love with no name and no explanation, like a river that cannot explain why it follows a particular course but simply flows onward. A love that asks for nothing and gives nothing in return; it is simply there. I will never be yours, and you will never be mine; nevertheless, I can honestly say: I love you, I love you, I love you.'''
** [[Paulo Coelho]], ''[[w:Aleph|Aleph]]'' (2011)

* '''What is a saint? A saint is someone who has achieved a remote human possibility. It is impossible to say what that possibility is. I think it has something to do with the energy of love.''' Contact with this energy results in the exercise of a kind of balance in the chaos of existence. '''A saint does not dissolve the chaos; if he did the world would have changed long ago. I do not think that a saint dissolves the chaos even for himself, for there is something arrogant and warlike in the notion of a man setting the universe in order. It is a kind of balance that is his glory.''' He rides the drifts like an escaped ski. His course is the caress of the hill. His track is a drawing of the snow in a moment of its particular arrangement with wind and rock. '''Something in him so loves the world that he gives himself to the laws of gravity and chance. Far from flying with the angels, he traces with the fidelity of a seismograph needle the state of the solid bloody landscape.''' His house is dangerous and finite, but he is at home in the world. He can love the shape of human beings, the fine and twisted shapes of the heart. '''It is good to have among us such men, such balancing monsters of love.'''
** [[Leonard Cohen]], ''[[w:Beautiful Losers|Beautiful Losers]]'' (1966).

* '''&quot;You have loved enough, now let me be the lover.&quot; You could say that God is speaking to you or the cosmos, or your lover. It just means, like, Forget it. Lean back and be loved by all that is already loving you. ''It is your effort at love that is preventing you from experiencing it.''''' It is like if you ever taught kids how to swim. The most difficult thing is Goddam to understand that they will float, if they relax, if they hold their breath and relax, they will actually float. For most kids it is difficult to swim. They feel they are going to sink like a stone to the bottom of the lake.
** [[Leonard Cohen]], On the lyrics to &quot;You Have Loved Enough&quot; in an interview released at the ''Ten New Songs'' site (2001)

* When they lay down beside me I made my confession to them. &lt;br&gt; They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem. &lt;br&gt; '''If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn, &lt;br&gt; They will bind you with love that is [[graceful]] and green as a stem.'''
** [[Leonard Cohen]], ''[[w:Songs of Leonard Cohen|Songs of Leonard Cohen]]'' (1967), ''Sisters of Mercy''

* I swept the marble chambers, &lt;br&gt; But you sent me down below. &lt;br&gt; You kept me from believing &lt;br&gt; Until you let me know: &lt;br&gt; That '''I am not the one who loves — &lt;br&gt; It's love that chooses me. &lt;br&gt; When hatred with his package comes, &lt;br&gt; You forbid delivery.''
** [[Leonard Cohen]], ''[[w:Ten New Songs|Ten New Songs]]'' (2001), ''You Have Loved Enough''

* '''In many ways doth the full heart reveal &lt;br&gt; The presence of the love it would conceal.'''
** [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], ''Poems Written in Later Life'', motto (1826).

* * I am dying, but without expectation of a speedy release. Is it not strange that very recently by-gone images, and scenes of early life, have stolen into my mind, like breezes blown from the spice-islands of Youth and Hope — those twin realities of this phantom world! I do not add Love, — for '''what is Love but Youth and Hope embracing, and so seen as ''one?'' I say ''realities''; for reality is a thing of degrees, from the Iliad to a dream.'''

* We are not expecting [[Utopia]] here on this [[earth]]. But [[God]] meant things to be much easier than we have made them. A man has a natural right to food, clothing, and shelter. A certain amount of goods is necessary to lead a good life. A family needs work as well as bread. Property is proper to man. We must keep repeating these things. [[Eternity|Eternal]] [[life]] begins now. &quot;All the way to [[heaven]] is heaven, because He said, &quot;I am the Way.&quot; The cross is there, of course, but &quot;in the cross is [[joy]] of [[spirit]].&quot; '''And [[love]] makes all things easy.'''

* '''What paralyzes life is lack of [[faith]] and lack of [[audacity]]. The difficulty lies not in solving problems but expressing them.''' And so we cannot avoid this conclusion: it is biologically evident that to gain control of passion and so make it serve spirit must be a condition of progress. Sooner or later, then, the world will brush aside our incredulity and take this step : because whatever is the more true comes out into the open, and whatever is better is ultimately realized.

* Today I begin to understand what love must be, if it exists. . . . When we are parted, we each feel the lack of the other half of ourselves. We are incomplete like a book in two volumes of which the first has been lost. That is what I imagine love to be: incompleteness in absence.

* The daily actions of religious people have accomplished uncounted good deeds throughout history, alleviating suffering, feeding the hungry, caring for the sick. Religions have brought the comfort of belonging and companionship to many who would otherwise have passed through this life all alone, without glory or adventure. They have not just provided first aid, in effect, for people in difficulties; they have provided the means for changing the world in ways that remove those difficulties. As Alan Wolfe says, &quot;Religion can lead people out of cycles of poverty and dependency just as it led Moses out of Egypt&quot;. There is much for religion lovers to be proud of in their traditions, and much for all of us to be grateful for.&lt;p&gt;The fact that so many people love their religions as much as, or more than, anything else in their lives is a weighty fact indeed. '''I am inclined to think that ''nothing could matter more'' than what people love. At any rate, I can think of no value that I would place higher. I would not want to live in a world without love. Would a world with peace, but without love, be a better world? Not if the peace was achieved by drugging the love (and hate) out of us, or by suppression. Would a world with justice and freedom, but without love, be a better world? Not if it was achieved by somehow turning us all into loveless law-abiders with none of the yearnings or envies or hatreds that are wellsprings of injustice and subjugation.'''&lt;p&gt;It is hard to consider such hypotheticals, and I doubt if we should trust our first intuitions about them, but, for what it is worth, I surmise that '''we almost all want a world in which love, justice, freedom, and peace are all present, as much as possible, but if we had to give up one of these, it wouldn't — and shouldn't — be love. But, sad to say, even if it is true that nothing could matter more than love, it wouldn't follow from this that we don't have reason to question the things that we, and others, love.''' Love is blind, as they say, and '''because love is blind, it often leads to tragedy: to conflicts in which one love is pitted against another love, and something has to give, with suffering guaranteed in any resolution.'''

* '''It is so important for us to have faith''', trust, confidence in one another. It is the only way we can communicate. '''Without faith there is no communication, there is no love, or if there was a little love, it will die without hope, trust, and confidence. Even if it doesn't die right away, it will be so weak, so ill, and so tired that communication will be miserable as well.'''

He spoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest. 'I love humanity,' he said, 'but I wonder at myself. '''The more I love humanity in general, the less I love man in particular.''' In my dreams,' he said, 'I have often come to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have faced crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary; and yet I am incapable of living in the same room with any one for two days together, as I know by experience. As soon as any one is near me, his personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom. In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one because he's too long over his dinner; another because he has a cold and keeps on blowing his nose. I become hostile to people the moment they come close to me. '''But it has always happened that the more I detest men individually the more ardent becomes my love for humanity.''''&quot;

* Brothers, have no fear of men's sin. '''Love a man even in his sin, for that is the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on earth. Love all God's creation, the whole of it and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf, every ray of God's light. Love [[all]] [[God]]'s creation, the [[whole]] of it and every grain of [[sand]] in it. Love every leaf, every ray of God's [[light]]. Love the [[animals]], love the [[plants]], love everything.

Once you have perceived it, you will begin to comprehend it better every day, and you will come at last to love the [[world]] with an all-embracing love.''' Love the animals: God has given them the rudiments of thought and untroubled joy. So do not trouble it, do not harass them, do not deprive them of their joy, do not go against God's intent. Man, do not exhale yourself above the animals: they are without sin, while you in your majesty defile the earth by your appearance on it, and you leave the traces of your defilement behind you — alas, this is true of almost every one of us! '''Love children especially, for like the angels they too are sinless, and they live to soften and purify our hearts, and, as it were, to guide us. Woe to him who offends a child.'''&lt;br /&gt; My young brother asked even the birds to forgive him. It may sound absurd, but it is right none the less, for everything, like the ocean, flows and enters into contact with everything else: touch one place, and you set up a movement at the other end of the world. It may be senseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but, then, it would be easier for the birds, and for the child, and for every animal if you were yourself more pleasant than you are now. Everything is like an ocean, I tell you. Then you would pray to the birds, too, consumed by a universal love, as though in ecstasy, and ask that they, too, should forgive your sin. '''Treasure this ecstasy, however absurd people may think it.'''

* '''Care and responsibility are constituent elements of love, but without respect for and knowledge of the beloved person, love deteriorates into domination and possessiveness.''' Respect is not fear and awe; it denotes, in accordance with the root of the word (''respicere'' = to look at), the ability to see a person as he is, to be aware of his individuality and uniqueness. To respect a person is not possible without knowing him; care and responsibilty would be blind if they were not guided by the knowledge of the person's individuality.
** [[Erich Fromm]], ''Man for Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics'' (1947),  Ch. 3
** In Ch. 2 of his later work ''The Art of Loving'' (1956) a similar statement is made:
:: Respect is not fear and awe; it denotes, in accordance with the root of the word (respicere = to look at), the ability to see a person as he is, to be aware of his unique individuality. '''Respect, thus, implies the absence of exploitation. I want the loved person to grow and unfold for his own sake, and in his own ways, and not for the purpose of serving me.'''

* '''Nationalism is our form of incest, is our idolatry, is our insanity.''' &quot;Patriotism” is its cult.

'''Just as love for one individual which excludes the love for others is not love, love for one’s country which is not part of one’s love for humanity is not love, but idolatrous worship.'''

* It is considered immoral to keep one &quot;love&quot; partner beyond a relatively short period of time. &quot;Love&quot; is short-lived sexual desire, which must be satisfied immediately.

* [[Envy]], [[jealousy]], [[ambition]], any kind of [[greed]] are [[passions]]; '''love is an [[action]], the practice of [[human]] [[power]], which can be practiced only in [[freedom]] and never as a result of compulsion.'''&lt;br&gt; Love is an activity, not a passive affect; it is a &quot;standing in,&quot; not a &quot;falling for.&quot; In the most general way, the active character of love can be described by stating that love is primarily ''giving'', not receiving.'''

* In spite of the universalistic spirit of the monotheistic Western religions and of the progressive political concepts that are expressed in the idea &quot;that all men are created [[equal]],&quot; love for [[mankind]] has not become a common [[experience]]. Love for mankind is looked upon as an achievement which, at best, follows love for an individual or as an abstract concept to be realized only in the future. But love for man cannot be separated from love for one individual. '''To love one person productively means to be related to his human core, to him as representing mankind. Love for one individual, in so far as it is divorced from love for man, can refer only to the superficial and to the accidental; of necessity it remains shallow.'''
** [[Erich Fromm]], [[w:The Art of Loving|The Art of Loving]]'' (1956), Ch. 2

* '''If a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to all others, his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged egotism.'''
** [[Erich Fromm]], [[w:The Art of Loving|The Art of Loving]]'' (1956)

* The spirit of a production-centered, commodity-greedy society is such that only the non-conformist can defend himself sufficiently against it. '''Those who are seriously concerned with love as the only rational answer to the problem of human existence must''', then, '''arrive at the conclusion that important and radical changes in our social structure are necessary, if love is to become a social and not a highly individualistic, marginal phenomenon.'''
** [[Erich Fromm]], [[w:The Art of Loving|The Art of Loving]]'' (1956)

* '''Our society is run by a managerial bureaucracy, by professional politicians; people are motivated by mass suggestion, their aim is producing more and consuming more, as purposes in themselves.''' All activities are subordinated to economic goals, means have become ends; man is an automaton — well fed, well clad, but without any ultimate concern for that which is his peculiarly human quality and function. If man is to be able to love, he must be put in his supreme place. The economic machine must serve him, rather than he serve it. He must be enabled to share experience, to share work, rather than, at best, share in profits. '''Society must be organized in such a way that man's social, loving nature is not separated from his social existence, but becomes one with it. If it is true, as I have tried to show, that love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence, then any society which excludes, relatively, the development of love, must in the long run perish of its own contradiction with the basic necessities of human nature.'''
** [[Erich Fromm]], [[w:The Art of Loving|The Art of Loving]]'' (1956)
** The portion of this statement, &quot;'''Love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence'''&quot; has been widely quoted alone, resulting in a less reserved expression, and sometimes the portion following it has been as well: &quot;Any society which excludes, relatively, the development of love, must in the long run perish of its own contradiction with the basic necessities of human nature.&quot;

* To speak of love is not &quot;preaching,&quot; for the simple reason that it means to speak of the ultimate and real need of every human being. That this need has been obscured does not mean it does not exist. To analyze the nature of love is to discover its general absence today and to criticize the social conditions which are responsible for this absence. '''To have faith in the possibility of love as a social and not only exceptional-individual phenomenon, is a rational faith based on the insight into the very nature of man.'''

Man has conquered whole nations, but all his armies could not conquer love. Man has chained and fettered the spirit, but he has been utterly helpless before love. '''High on a throne, with all the splendor and pomp his gold can command, man is yet poor and desolate, if love passes him by.

* '''At the risk of seeming ridiculous, let me say that the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love. It is impossible to think of a genuine revolutionary lacking this quality.''' Perhaps it is one of the great dramas of the leader that he or she must combine a passionate spirit with a cold intelligence and make painful decisions without flinching. Our vanguard revolutionaries must idealize this love of the people, of the most sacred causes, and make it one and indivisible. They cannot descend, with small doses of daily affection, to the level where ordinary people put their love into practice.&lt;br&gt; The leaders of the revolution have children just beginning to talk, who are not learning to call their fathers by name; wives, from whom they have to be separated as part of the general sacrifice of their lives to bring the revolution to its fulfilment; the circle of their friends is limited strictly to the number of fellow revolutionists. There is no life outside of the revolution.&lt;br&gt;In these circumstances one must have a great deal of humanity and a strong sense of justice and truth in order not to fall into extreme dogmatism and cold scholasticism, into isolation from the masses. '''We must strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into actual deeds, into acts that serve as examples, as a moving force.'''

* '''Love is the only bow on Life's dark cloud. It is the morning and the evening star.''' It shines upon the babe, and sheds its radiance on the quiet tomb. It is the mother of art, inspirer of poet, patriot and philosopher. It is the air and light of every heart — builder of every home, kindler of every fire on every hearth. It was the first to dream of immortality. It fills the world with melody — for music is the voice of love. Love is the magician, the enchanter, that changes worthless things to Joy, and makes royal kings and queens of common clay.

* '''[[Romeo and Juliet|Romeo wants Juliet]] as the filings want the magnet; and if no obstacles intervene he moves towards her by as straight a line as they.''' But Romeo and Juliet, if a wall be built between them, do not remain idiotically pressing their faces against its opposite sides like the magnet and the filings with the card. Romeo soon finds a circuitous way, by scaling the wall or otherwise, of touching Juliet's lips directly. With the filings the path is fixed; whether it reaches the end depends on accidents. '''With the [[Love|lover]] it is the end which is fixed, the path may be modified indefinitely.'''

* '''If you say that this is absurd, that we cannot be in love with everyone at once, I merely point out to you that, as a matter of fact, certain persons do exist with an enormous capacity for friendship and for taking delight in other people's lives; and that such person know more of truth than if their hearts were not so big. The vice of ordinary Jack and Jill affection is not its intensity, but its exclusions and its jealousies. Leave those out, and you see that the ideal I am holding up before you, however impracticable to-day, yet contains nothing intrinsically absurd.'''

** [[John of the Cross]], ''[[w:Spiritual Canticle|Spiritual Canticle of The Soul and The Bridegroom]]'', stanza 28

* '''I have said that [[God]] is pleased with nothing but [[love]]; but before I explain this, it will be as well to set forth the grounds on which the assertion rests. [[All]] our [[works]], and all our labours, how grand soever they may be, are nothing in the sight of God, for we can give Him nothing, neither can we by them fulfil His desire, which is the growth of our soul. As to Himself He desires nothing of this, for He has need of nothing, and so, if He is pleased with anything it is with the [[growth]] of the [[soul]]; and as there is no way in which the soul can grow but in becoming in a manner equal to Him, for this reason only is He pleased with our love.''' It is the property of love to place him who loves on an equality with the object of his love. Hence the soul, because of its perfect love, is called the bride of the Son of God, which signifies equality with Him. In this equality and [[friendship]] all things are common, as the Bridegroom Himself said to His disciples: ''I have called you friends, because all things, whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you.''

* '''When the soul, then, in any degree possesses the spirit of solitary love, we must not interfere with it.''' We should inflict a grievous wrong upon it, and upon the Church also, if we were to occupy it, were it only for a moment, in exterior or active duties, however important they might be. When God Himself adjures all not to waken it from its love, who shall venture to do so, and be blameless? '''In a word, it is for this love that we are all created.''' Let those men of zeal, who think by their preaching and exterior works to convert the world, consider that they would be much more edifying to the Church, and more pleasing unto God — setting aside the good example they would give if they would spend at least one half their time in prayer, even though they may have not attained to the state of unitive love.

* Do you want me to tell you something really subversive? Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. . . . It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk everything, you risk even more.
** [[Erica Jong]] in ''How to Save Your Own Life'' (1977)

* '''Love (understood as the desire of good for another) is in fact so unnatural a phenomenon that it can scarcely repeat itself, the soul being unable to become virgin again and not having energy enough to cast itself out again into the ocean of another's soul.'''

Where Truth and Wisdom are verily, there is Love verily, coming of them both.''' And all of God’s making: for He is endless sovereign Truth, endless sovereign Wisdom, endless sovereign Love, unmade; and man’s Soul is a creature in God which hath the same properties ''made'', and evermore it doeth that it was made for: it seeth God, it beholdeth God, and it loveth God. Whereof God enjoyeth in the creature; and the creature in God, endlessly marvelling.''' &lt;br&gt; In which marvelling he seeth his God, his Lord, his Maker so high, so great, and so good, in comparison with him that is made, that scarcely the creature seemeth ought to the self. But the clarity and the clearness of Truth and Wisdom maketh him to see and to bear witness that he is made for Love, in which God endlessly keepeth him.

* '''The ground of mercy is love, and the working of mercy is our keeping in love.''' And this was shewed in such manner that I could not have perceived of the part of mercy but as it were alone in love; that is to say, as to my sight.
** [[Julian of Norwich]], ''Revelations of Divine Love'' (c. 1393), Ch. 48

* '''Mercy is a sweet gracious working in love, mingled with plenteous pity: for mercy worketh in keeping us, and mercy worketh turning to us all things to good.''' Mercy, by love, suffereth us to fail in measure and in as much as we fail, in so much we fall; and in as much as we fall, in so much we die: for it needs must be that we die in so much as we fail of the sight and feeling of God that is our life. Our failing is dreadful, our falling is shameful, and our dying is sorrowful: but in all this the sweet eye of pity and love is lifted never off us, nor the working of mercy ceaseth. &lt;br&gt; '''For I beheld the property of mercy, and I beheld the property of grace: which have two manners of working in one love.'''
** [[Julian of Norwich]], ''Revelations of Divine Love'' (c. 1393), Ch. 48

* '''Our life is all grounded and rooted in love, and without love we may not live.'''
** [[Julian of Norwich]], ''Revelations of Divine Love'' (c. 1393), Ch. 48

* '''Love and Dread are brethren, and they are rooted in us by the Goodness of our Maker, and they shall never be taken from us without end. We have of nature to love and we have of grace to love: and we have of nature to dread and we have of grace to dread.'''

* Where I say that He abideth sorrowfully and moaning, it meaneth all the true feeling that ''we'' have in our self, in contrition and compassion, and all sorrowing and moaning that we are not oned with our Lord. And all such that is speedful, it is Christ in us. And though some of us feel it seldom, it passeth never from Christ till what time He hath brought us out of all our woe. '''For love suffereth never to be without pity.'''
** [[Julian of Norwich]], ''Revelations of Divine Love'' (c. 1393), Ch. 80

* '''If any such lover be in earth which is continually kept from falling, I know it not: for it was not shewed me. But this was shewed: that in falling and in rising we are ever preciously kept in one Love.'''

* ''Wouldst thou learn thy Lord’s meaning in this thing? Learn it well: '''Love was His meaning'''. Who shewed it thee? '''Love'''. What shewed He thee? '''Love'''. Wherefore shewed it He? For '''Love'''. Hold thee therein and thou shalt learn and know more in the same. But thou shalt never know nor learn therein other thing without end.''

* The resolving of the ethical, is freedom; the negative resolution also has this, but the '''freedom''', blank and bare, is as if tongue-tied, hard to express, and generally has something hard in its nature. Falling in love, however, promptly sets it to music, even if this composition contains a very difficult passage.

* '''In order to eliminate misunderstandings, the main point is that marriage is a [[w:Telos (philosophy)|τέλος]], yet not for nature’s striving so that we touch on the meaning of the τέλος in the mysteries, but for the individuality. But if it is a τέλος, it is not something immediate but an act of freedom, and belonging under freedom as it does, the task is actualized only through a resolution. Erotic love or falling in love is altogether immediate; marriage is a resolution; yet falling in love must be taken up into marriage or into the resolution; to will to marry-that is the most immediate of all immediacies must also be the freest resolution, that which is so inexplicable in its immediacy that it must be attributed to a deity must also come about by virtue of deliberation, and such exhaustive deliberation that from it a resolution results. Furthermore, the one must not follow the other; the resolution must not come slinking along behind but must occur simultaneously; both parts must be present in the moment of decision. If deliberation has not exhausted thought, then I make no resolution; I act either on inspiration or on the basis of a whim.'''

* '''The eternal fears no future, hopes for no future, but [[love]] possesses everything without ceasing, and there is no shadow of variation.''' As soon as he returns to himself, he understands this no more. He understands what bitter experiences have only all too unforgettably inculcated, the self-accusation, if the past has the kind of claim upon his soul that no repentance can entirely redeem, no trusting in God can entirely wipe out, but only God himself in the inexpressible silence of beatitude. The more of the past a person’s soul can still keep when he is left to himself, the more profound he is.

* When love lives in the heart, the eye is shut and does not discover the open act of sin, to say nothing of the concealed act … When love lives in the heart, the ear is shut and does not hear what the world says, does not hear the bitterness of blasphemy, because he who says, “you fool”, to his brother is guilty before the council, but he who hears it when it is said to him is not perfect in love. … When rashness lives in the heart, a person is quick to discover the multiplicity of sin, then he understands splendidly a fragmentary utterance, hastily comprehends at a distance something scarcely enunciated. '''When love lives in the heart, a person understands slowly and does not hear at all words said in haste and does not understand them when repeated because he assigns them good position and a good meaning. He does not understand a long angry and insulting verbal assault, because he is waiting for one more word that will give it meaning.''' When fear lives in the heart, a person easily discovers the multiplicity of sin, discovers deceit and delusion and disloyalty and scheming, discovers that; Every heart is a net, Every rogue like a child, Every promise like a shadow. But the love that hides a multitude of sins is never deceived.
** [[Søren Kierkegaard]],''[[w:Three Upbuilding Discourses|Three Upbuilding Discourses]]'', Love Will Hide a Multitude of Sins, p. 60-61

* When stinginess lives in the heart, when one gives with one eye and looks with seven to see what one obtains in return one readily discovers the multiplicity of sin. But when love lives in the heart, then the eye is never deceived, because when love gives, it does not watch the gift but keeps its eye on the Lord. When envy lives in the heart, the eye has the power to elicit the impure even from the pure; but when love lives in the heart, the eye has the power to love forth the good in the impure, but his eye sees not the impure but the pure, which it loves, and loves forth by loving it. Yes, '''there is a power in this world that in its language translates good into evil, but there is power from above that translates evil into good-it is the love that hides a multitude of sins.''' … When hate lives in the heart, sin is right there at the door of a human being, and the multitude of its cravings is present to him. But when love lives in the heart, then sin flees far away and he does not even catch a glimpse of it.

* But '''with love it is most joyous of all. For there is a love, that blazes up and is forgotten'''; there is a love that unites and divides -- a love until death. But then -- in death, in death’s decision, there is born a love that does not flame up, that is not equivocal, that is not -- until death, but beyond death, a love that endures. In this love under the pain of the wish, the sufferer is committed to the Good. Oh, you sufferer, whoever you may be, will you then with doubleness of mind seek the relief that temporal existence can give, the relief that permits you to forget your suffering (yes, so you think) but rather that allows you to forget the Eternal! Will you in doubleness of mind despair, because all is lost (yes, so you think) yet with the Eternal all is to be won! Will you in doubleness of mind despair? Have you considered what it is to despair? Alas, it is to deny that God is love! Think that over properly, one who despairs abandons himself (yes, so you think); nay, he abandons God! Oh, weary not your soul with that which is passing and with momentary relief. Grieve not your spirit with forms of comfort which this world affords. Do not in suicidal fashion murder the wish; but rather win the highest by hope, by faith, by love -- as the mightiest of all are able to do: commit yourself to the Good!

Love and friendship are the very height of self-feeling, the I intoxicated in the other-I. The more securely the two I's come together to become one I, the more this united I selfishly cuts itself off from all others.'''

* '''Perfection in the object is not perfection in the love.''' Erotic love is determined by the object; friendship is determined by the object; only love of one’s neighbor is determined by love.

* &quot;'''Is changingness indeed a stronger power than changelessness''', and who is the stronger, the one who says, “If you will not love me, then I will hate you,” or the one who says, “If you hate me, I will still continue to love you”?&quot; &quot;'''The one who loves presupposes that love is in the other person’s heart and by this very presupposition builds up love in him – from the ground up, provided, of course, that in love he presupposes its presence in the ground.'''&quot; &quot;There is nothing, no ‘thus and so,’ that can unconditionally be said to demonstrate unconditionally the presence of love or to demonstrate unconditionally its absence...&quot; &quot;Thus even giving to charity, visiting the widow, and clothing the naked do not truly demonstrate or make known a person’s love, inasmuch as one can do works of love in an unloving way, yes, even in a self-loving way.&quot; &quot;The self-deceived person may even think he is able to console others who became victims of perfidious deception, but what insanity when someone who himself has lost the eternal wants to heal the person who is extremely sick unto death!&quot; &quot;Just as the quiet lake originates deep down in hidden springs no eye has seen, so also does a person’s love originate even more deeply in God’s love.&quot; ... So a human being’s love originates mysteriously in God’s love.&quot; Every human being by his life, by his conduct, by his behavior in everyday affairs, by his association with his peers, by his words, his remarks, should and could build up and would do it if love were really present in him.&quot;  &quot;Only the unloving person fancies that he should build up by controlling the other; the one who loves presupposes continually that love is present and in just that way he builds up.&quot; &quot;The one who loves builds up by controlling himself.&quot; &quot;It is God, the Creator, who must implant love in each human being, he who himself is Love. Thus '''it is specifically unloving and not at all upbuilding if someone arrogantly deludes himself into believing that he wants and is able to create love in another person.&quot; &quot;Truly, love is to be known by its fruit, but still it does not follow from this that you are to take it upon yourself to be the expert knower.''' &quot; &quot;If it is usually difficult to begin without presuppositions, '''it is truly most difficult of all to begin to build up with the presupposition that love is present and to end with the same presupposition.'''&quot;

* '''Learning in the true sense of the word is possible only in that state of attention, in which there is no outer or inner compulsion. Right thinking can come about only when the mind is not enslaved by tradition and memory.''' It is attention that allows silence to come upon the mind, which is the opening of the door to creation. That is why attention is of the highest importance. Knowledge is necessary at the functional level as a means of cultivating the mind, and not as an end in itself. '''We are concerned, not with the development of just one capacity, such as that of a mathematician, or a scientist, or a musician, but with the total development of the student as a human being.''' How is the state of attention to be brought about? It cannot be cultivated through persuasion, comparison, reward or punishment, all of which are forms of coercion. The elimination of fear is the beginning of attention. Fear must exist as long as there is an urge to be or to become, which is the pursuit of success, with all its frustrations and tortuous contradictions. You can teach concentration, but attention cannot be taught just as you cannot possibly teach freedom from fear; but we can begin to discover the causes that produce fear, and in understanding these causes there is the elimination of fear. So attention arises spontaneously when around the student there is an atmosphere of well-being, when he has the feeling of being secure, of being at ease, and is aware of the disinterested action that comes with love. '''Love does not compare, and so the envy and torture of &quot;becoming&quot; cease.'''

*'''You know, actually we have no love — that is a terrible thing to realize.''' Actually we have no love; we have sentiment; we have emotionality, sensuality, sexuality; we have remembrances of something which we have thought as love. But actually, brutally, we have no love. Because to have love means no violence, no fear, no competition, no ambition. If you had love you will never say, &quot;This is my family.&quot; '''You may have a family and give them the best you can; but it will not be &quot;your family&quot; which is opposed to the world. If you love, if there is love, there is peace. If you loved, you would educate your child not to be a nationalist, not to have only a technical job and look after his own petty little affairs; you would have no nationality. There would be no divisions of religion, if you loved.''' But as these things actually exist — not theoretically, but brutally — in this ugly world, it shows that you have no love. Even the love of a mother for her child is not love. If the mother really loved her child, do you think the world would be like this? She would see that he had the right food, the right education, that he was sensitive, that he appreciated beauty, that he was not ambitious, greedy, envious. So the mother, however much she may think she loves her child, does not love the child. So we have not that love.

* '''Can't you fall in love and not have a possessive relationship? I love someone and she loves me and we get married — that is all perfectly straightforward and simple, in that there is no conflict at all.''' (When I say we get married I might just as well say we decide to live together — don't let's get caught up in words.) Can't one have that without the other, without the tail as it were, necessarily following? Can't two people be in love and both be so intelligent and so sensitive that there is freedom and absence of a centre that makes for conflict? '''Conflict is not in the feeling of being in love. The feeling of being in love is utterly without conflict. There is no loss of energy in being in love.''' The loss of energy is in the tail, in everything that follows — jealousy, possessiveness, suspicion, doubt, the fear of losing that love, the constant demand for reassurance and security. Surely it must be possible to function in a sexual relationship with someone you love without the nightmare which usually follows. Of course it is.

* The whole of Asia believes in reincarnation, in being reborn in another life. When you enquire what it is that is going to be born in the next life, you come up against difficulties. What is it? Yourself? What are you? a lot of words, a lot of opinions, attachments to your possessions, to your furniture, to your conditioning. Is all that, which you call the soul, going to be reborn in the next life? Reincarnation implies that what you are today determines what you will be again in the next life. Therefore behave! — not tomorrow, but today, because what you do today you are going to pay for in the next life. People who believe in reincarnation do not bother about behavior;t all; it is just a matter of belief, which has no value. Incarnate today, afresh not in the next life! '''Change it now completely, change with great passion, let the mind strip itself of everything, of every conditioning, every knowledge, of everything it thinks is &quot;right&quot; — empty it. Then you will know what dying means; and then you will know what love is. For love is not something of the past, of thought, of culture; it is not pleasure. A mind that has understood the whole movement of thought becomes extraordinarily quiet, absolutely silent. That silence is the beginning of the new.'''

*'''It is utterly and irrevocably possible to empty all hurts and, therefore, to love, to have compassion.''' To have compassion means to have passion for all things, not just between two people, but for all human beings, for all things of the earth, the animals, the trees, everything the earth contains. '''When we have such compassion we will not despoil the earth as we are doing now, and we will have no wars.'''
** [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], ''Talks in Saanen'' (1974), p. 71

*'''The only thing that really matters is that there be an action of goodness, love and intelligence in living.''' Is goodness individual or collective, is love personal or impersonal, is intelligence yours, mine or somebody else? If it is yours or mine then it is not intelligence, or love, or goodness. If goodness is an affair of the individual or of the collective, according to one's particular preference or decision, then it is no longer goodness.'''
** [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], ''The Urgency of Change'' (1970), Conversation 5''

*'''The very nature of intelligence is sensitivity, and this sensitivity is love.''' Without this intelligence there can be no compassion. Compassion is not the doing of charitable acts or social reform; it is free from sentiment, romanticism and emotional enthusiasm. It is as strong as death. It is like a great rock, immovable in the midst of confusion, misery and anxiety. Without this compassion no new culture or society can come into being. '''Compassion and intelligence walk together; they are not separate. Compassion acts through intelligence.''' It can never act through the intellect. '''Compassion is the essence of the wholeness of life.'''
** [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], ''Letters to the Schools'' (1981, 1985), Vol. I, p. 113 &lt;!-- 90? intellectual cleverness that remains merely cynical and confined to the personal or partisan contrasted with wise compassionate awareness which transcends such bounds and abides with the eternal and universal qualities and vital resolutions beyond all mortal aims. --&gt;

* Questioner: Can one love truth without loving man? Can one love man without loving truth? What comes first? &lt;br&gt; Krishnamurti: '''Love comes first.''' To love truth, you must know truth. To know truth is to deny truth. '''What is known is not truth.''' What is known is already encased in time and ceases to be truth. Truth is an eternal movement, and so cannot be measured in words or in time. It cannot be held in the fist. '''You cannot love something which you do not know. But truth is not to be found in books, in images, in temples. It is to be found in action, in living. The very search for the unknown is love itself''', and you cannot search for the unknowable away from relationship. You cannot search for reality, or for what you will, in isolation. It comes into being only in relationship, only when there is right relationship between man and man. So the love of man is the search for reality.
** [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], ''The Collected Works'', Vol. IV, p. 172

* '''Please let us be clear on this point — that you cannot by any process, through any discipline, through any form of meditation, go to truth, God, or whatever name you like to give it. It is much too vast, it cannot possibly be conceived of; no description will cover it, no book can hold it, nor any word contain it.''' So you cannot by any devious method, by any sacrifice, by any discipline or through any guru, go to it. '''You must await it, it will come to you, you cannot go to it.''' That is the fundamental thing one has to understand, that not through any trick of the mind, not through any control, through any virtue, any compulsion, any form of suppression, can the mind possibly go to truth. All that the mind can do is be quiet but not with the intention of receiving it. And that is one of the most difficult things of all because we think truth can be experienced right away through doing certain things. '''Truth is not to be bought any more than love can be bought.'''

* '''We know only fragmentarily this extraordinary thing called life'''; we have never looked at sorrow, except through the screen of escapes; we have never seen the beauty, the immensity of death, and we know it only through fear and sadness. There can be understanding of life, and of the significance and beauty of death, only when the mind on the instant perceives “what is”.You know, sirs, although we differentiate them, love, death, and sorrow are all the same; because, surely, love, death, and sorrow are the unknowable. '''The moment you know love, you have ceased to love. Love is beyond time; it has no beginning and no end, whereas knowledge has; and when you say, “I know what love is”, you don’t. You know only a sensation, a stimulus. You know the reaction to love, but that reaction is not love.''' In the same way, you don’t know what death is. You know only the reactions to death, and you will discover the full depth and significance of death only when the reactions have ceased.

* '''Give in to love, or live in fear.'''

* '''Now the [[Spirit]] of [[Love]] has this Original. [[God]], as considered in himself in his Holy Being, before any thing is brought forth by him or out of him, is only an eternal Will to [[all]] [[Goodness]].''' This is the one eternal immutable God, that from [[Eternity]] to Eternity changeth not, that can be neither more nor less nor any thing else but an eternal Will to all the Goodness that is in himself, and can come from him. The Creation of ever so many Worlds or Systems of Creatures adds nothing to, nor takes any thing from this immutable God. He always was and always will be the same immutable Will to all Goodness. So that as certainly as he is the Creator, so certainly is he the Blesser of every created Thing, and can give nothing but Blessing, Goodness, and Happiness from himself because he has in himself nothing else to give. '''It is much more possible for the Sun to give forth Darkness, than for God to do, or be, or give forth anything but Blessing and Goodness.''' Now this is the Ground and Original of the Spirit of Love in the Creature; it is and must be a Will to all Goodness, and you have not the Spirit of Love till you have this Will to all Goodness at all Times and on all Occasions. You may indeed do many Works of Love and delight in them, especially at such Times as they are not inconvenient to you, or contradictory to your State or Temper or Occurrences in Life. But the Spirit of Love is not in you till it is the Spirit of your Life, till you live freely, willingly, and universally according to it. For every Spirit acts with Freedom and Universality according to what it is. It needs no command to live its own Life, or be what it is, no more than you need bid Wrath be wrathful. '''And therefore when Love is the Spirit of your Life, it will have the Freedom and Universality of a Spirit; it will always live and work in Love, not because of This or That, Here or There, but because the Spirit of Love can only love, wherever it is or goes or whatever is done to it.''' As the Sparks know no Motion but that of flying upwards, whether it be in the Darkness of the Night or in the Light of the Day, so the Spirit of Love is always in the same Course; it knows no Difference of Time, Place, or Persons, but whether it gives or forgives, bears or forbears, it is equally doing its own delightful Work, equally blessed from itself. '''For the Spirit of Love, wherever it is, is its own Blessing and Happiness because it is the Truth and Reality of God in the Soul, and therefore is in the same Joy of Life and is the same Good to itself, everywhere and on every Occasion.'''

* &quot;But tell me how it is that she could be so beautiful without any [[heart]] at all — without any place even for a heart to live in.&quot; &quot;I cannot quite tell,&quot; she said; &quot;but I am sure she would not look so beautiful if she did not take means to make herself look more beautiful than she is. And then, you know, you began by being in love with her before you saw her beauty ... But the chief thing that makes her beautiful is this: that, although she loves no man, she loves the love of any man; and when she finds one in her power, her desire to bewitch him and gain his love (not for the sake of his love either, but that she may be conscious anew of her own beauty, through the admiration he manifests), makes her very lovely—with a self-destructive beauty...&quot;

* I knew now, that '''it is by loving, and not by being loved, that one can come nearest the soul of another'''; yea, that, '''where two love, it is the loving of each other, and not the being loved by each other, that originates and perfects and assures their blessedness.''' I knew that love gives to him that loveth, power over any soul beloved, even if that soul know him not, bringing him inwardly close to that spirit; a power that cannot be but for good; for in proportion as selfishness intrudes, the love ceases, and the power which springs therefrom dies. Yet '''all love will, one day, meet with its return. All true love will, one day, behold its own image in the eyes of the beloved, and be humbly glad.'''

* To him she seemed so beautiful, so seductive, so different from ordinary people, that he could not understand why no one was as disturbed as he by the clicking of her heels on the paving stones, why no one else's heart was wild with the breeze stirred by the sighs of her veils, why everyone did not go mad with the movements of her braid, the flight of her hands, the gold of her laughter.

* '''All true morality, inward and outward, is comprehended in love, for love is the foundation of all the commandments.''' &lt;br&gt; All outward morality must be built upon this basis, not on self-interest. As long as man loves something else than God, or outside God, he is not free, because he has not love. Therefore there is no inner freedom which does not manifest itself in works of love. True freedom is the government of nature in and outside man through God; freedom is essential existence unaffected by creatures. But love often begins with fear; fear is the approach to love: fear is like the awl which draws the shoemaker's thread through the leather.

** [[Thomas Merton]], in ''Seeds of Contemplation'' (1949)

* '''Persons are not known by intellect alone, not by principles alone, but only by love.

It is only this realization that can open to us the real nature of our duty, and of right action.
** [[Thomas Merton]], in a letter to [[Dorothy Day]] (20 December 1961)

* Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink &lt;br&gt; Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain; &lt;br&gt; Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink &lt;br&gt; And rise and sink and rise and sink again; &lt;br&gt; Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, &lt;br&gt; Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; &lt;br&gt; '''Yet many a man is making friends with death &lt;br&gt; Even as I speak, for lack of love alone.'''

* '''Love is our response to our highest values.'''
** [[Ayn Rand]], [[Atlas Shrugged]] (1957)

* '''Love is the expression of one's values, the greatest reward you can earn for the moral qualities you have achieved in your character and person, the emotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues of another.'''
** [[Ayn Rand]], [[Atlas Shrugged]] (1957)

* &quot;Love is blind, they say; sex is impervious to reason and mocks the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a man's sexual choice is the result and the sum of his fundamental convictions. Tell me what a man finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life. Show me the woman he sleeps with and I will tell you his valuation of himself... The man who is proudly certain of his own value, will want the highest type of woman he can find, the woman he admires, the strongest, the hardest to conquer—because only the possession of a heroine will give him the sense of an achievement, not the possession of a brainless slut.&quot;
** Francisco d'Anconia in [[Ayn Rand]], [[Atlas Shrugged]] (1957), Part Two: Either-Or, Chapter Four: The Sanction of the Victim

* &quot;Let a man corrupt his values and his view of existence, let him profess that love is not self-enjoyment but self-denial, that virtue consists, not of pride, but of pity or pain or weakness or sacrifice, that '''the noblest love is born, not of admiration, but of charity, not in response to values, but in response to flaws'''—and he will have cut himself in two. His body will not obey him, it will not respond, it will make him impotent toward the woman he professes to love and draw him to the lowest type of whore he can find. His body will always follow the ultimate logic of his deepest convictions; if he believes that flaws are values, he has damned existence as evil and only the evil will attract him. He has damned himself and he will feel that depravity is all he is worthy of enjoying.&quot;
** Francisco d'Anconia in [[Ayn Rand]], [[Atlas Shrugged]] (1957), Part Two: Either-Or, Chapter Four: The Sanction of the Victim

* One can't love man without hating most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name.

* '''To say 'I love you' one must know first how to say the 'I.''''
** [[Ayn Rand]], [[The Fountainhead]] (1943)

* '''&quot;We never need to say anything to each other when we're together. This is- for the time when we won't be together. I love you, Dominique. As selfishly as the fact that I exist. As selfishly as my lungs breath air. I breathe for my own necessity, for the fuel of my body, for my survival. I've given you not my sacrifice or my pity, but my ego and my naked need. This is the only way you can wish to be loved. This is the only way I can want you to love me. If you married me now, I would become your whole existence. But I would not want you then. You would not want yourself-and so you would not love me long. To say 'I love you' one must first know how to say the 'I'. The kind of surrender I could have from you now would give me nothing but an empty hulk. If I demanded it, I'd destroy you. That's why I won't stop you. I'll let you go to your husband. I don't know how I'll live through tonight, but I will. I want you whole, as I am, as you'll remain in the battle you've chosen. A battle is never selfless. [...] You must learn not to be afraid of the world. Not to be held by it as you are now. Never to be hurt by it as you were in that courtroom. I must let you learn it. I can't help you. You must find your own way. When you have, you'll come back to me. They won't destroy me, Dominique. And they won't destroy you. You'll win, because you've chosen the hardest way of fighting for your freedom from the world. I'll wait for you. I love you. I'm saying this now for all the years we'll have to wait. I love you, Dominique.&quot;'''
** Howard Roark in [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[The Fountainhead]] (1943), Part II

They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt and general indifference, and they call it love. Once you've felt what it means to love as you and I know it--the total passion for the total height--you're incapable of anything less.&quot;'''
** Gail Wynand, speaking to Dominique Keating in [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[The Fountainhead]] (1943), Part III

* '''&quot;...love is exception-making.&quot;'''
** Gail Wynand, in [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[The Fountainhead]] (1943), Part IV

* '''To get things done, you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences. The work, not the people. Your own action, not any possible object of your charity.'''
** Howard Roark in [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[The Fountainhead]] (1943), Part IV, p. 578

* &quot;What you feel in the presence of a thing you admire is just one word--'Yes.' The affirmation, the acceptance, the sign of admittance. And that 'Yes' is more than an answer to one thing, it's a kind of 'Amen' to life, to the earth that holds this thing, to the thought that created it, to yourself for being able to see it. But the ability to say 'Yes' or 'No' is the essence of all ownership. It's your ownership of your own ego. Your soul, if you wish. Your soul has a single basic function--the act of valuing. 'Yes' or 'No,' 'I wish' or 'I do not wish.' You can't say 'Yes' without saying 'I.&quot; There's no affirmation without the one who affirms. '''In this sense, everything to which you grant your love is yours.'''&lt;br&gt;[...]&lt;br&gt;&quot;Howard, that 'Yes'--once granted, can it be withdrawn?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Never.&quot;

* '''Some day, the world will discover that, without thought, there can be no love.'''
** [[Ayn Rand]], Apollo and Dionysus (1969)

* [The hippies] were told that love - indiscriminate love for one's fellow man - is the highest virtue, and they obeyed. They were told that the merging of one's self with a herd, tribe, or community is the noblest way for a man to live, and they obeyed. There isn't a philosophical idea of today's establishment which they have not accepted, which they do not share. When they discovered this philosophy did not work, because in fact it cannot work, the hippies had neither the wit nor the courage to challenge it. They found, instead, an outlet for their impotent frustration by accusing their elders of hypocrisy, as if hypocrisy were the only obstacle to the realization of their dreams. And, left blindly, helplessly lobotomized in the face of an inexplicable reality that is not amenable to their feelings, they have no recourse but the shouting of obscenities at anything that frustrates their whims; at man, or at the rainy sky, indiscriminately, with no concept of the difference. '''It is typical of today's culture that the proponents of seething, raging hostility are taken as advocates of love.'''
** [[Ayn Rand]], Apollo and Dionysus (1969)

* ''Liebe, Arbeit und Wissen sind die Quellen unseres Lebens. Sie sollen es auch regieren.''
** '''Love, [[work]] and [[knowledge]] are the well-springs of our [[life]]. They should also [[govern]] it.'''
*** [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s personal motto, the English translation used at least as early as ''The Function of the Orgasm'' (1948), a translation of ''Die Funktion des Orgasmus'' (1927).

* Psychic health depends on orgastic potency, i.e., upon the degree to which one can surrender to and experience the climax of excitation in the natural sexual act. It is founded upon the healthy character attitude of the individual's capacity for love. '''Psychic illnesses are the result of a disturbance of the natural capacity for love.'''
** [[Wilhelm Reich]], ''The Function of the Orgasm'' (1927), General Survey

* '''Only the liberation of the natural capacity for love in human beings can master their sadistic destructiveness.''' &lt;!-- p. 173 --&gt;
** [[Wilhelm Reich]], ''The Function of the Orgasm'' (1927), Ch. V : The Development of the Character-Analytic Technique

* You beg for happiness in life, but security is more important to you, even if it costs you your spine or your life. '''Your life will be good and secure when aliveness will mean more to you than security; love more than money; your freedom more than party line or public opinion'''; when your thinking will be in harmony with your feelings; when the teachers of your children will be better paid than the politicians; when you will have more respect for the love between man and woman than for a marriage license.
** [[Wilhelm Reich]], ''Listen, Little Man!'' (1948)

* '''Follow the [[voice]] of your [[heart]], even if it leads you off the path of timid [[souls]]. Do not become hard and embittered, even if life tortures you at times. There is only one thing that counts: to live one's life well and happily...'''
** [[Wilhelm Reich]], ''Listen, Little Man!'' (1948)

** [[Kenneth Rexroth]], ''In Defense of the Earth'' (1956)

* '''Now I know surely and forever, &lt;br&gt;However much I have blotted our &lt;br&gt;Waking love, its memory is still &lt;br&gt;there.''' And I know the web, the net, &lt;br&gt;The blind and crippled bird. For then, for &lt;br&gt;One brief instant it was not blind, nor &lt;br&gt;Trapped, not crippled. '''For one heart beat the &lt;br&gt;Heart was free and moved itself. O love, &lt;br&gt;I who am lost and damned with words, &lt;br&gt;Whose words are a business and an art, &lt;br&gt;I have no words. These words, this poem, this &lt;br&gt;Is all confusion and ignorance. &lt;br&gt;But I know that coached by your sweet heart, &lt;br&gt;My heart beat one free beat and sent &lt;br&gt;Through all my flesh the blood of truth.'''
** [[Kenneth Rexroth]], ''She Is Away''

* '''Each of us is a specific individual, that one and no other, out of billions.''' I think each of us knows his own mystery with a knowing that precedes the origins of all knowledge. None of us ever gives it away. No one can. We envelop it with talk and hide it with deeds. &lt;br&gt; Yet we always hope that somehow the others will know it is there, that '''a mystery in the other we cannot know will respond to a mystery in the self we cannot understand. The only full satisfaction life offers us is this sense of communion. We seek it constantly. Sometimes we find it. As we grow older we learn that it is never complete and sometimes it is entirely illusory.'''

** [[Romain Rolland]], as quoted in ''On Relationships: A Book for Teenagers'' (1999) by Kimberly Kirberger

* A mature person is one who does not think only in absolutes, who is able to be objective even when deeply stirred emotionally, who has learned that there is both good and bad in all people and all things, and who walks humbly and deals charitably with the circumstances of life, knowing that in this world ''no one is all-knowing and therefore all of us need both love and charity.'''
** [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], ''You Learn by Living'' (1960), p. 63

* '''It takes courage to love, but pain through love is the purifying fire which those who love generously know.''' We all know people who are so much afraid of pain that they shut themselves up like clams in a shell and, giving out nothing, receive nothing and therefore shrink until life is a mere living death. (1 April 1939)
** [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], ''My Day'' (1935 - 1962), Her daily newspaper column (1 April 1939)

* '''We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing ''because''. That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something ''despite''. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect.'''

* Love as a relation between men and women was ruined by the desire to make sure of the legitimacy of children.
** [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[w:Marriage and Morals|Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929), Ch. 3: The Dominion of the Father

* I believe myself that romantic '''love is the source of the most intense delights that life has to offer. In the relation of a man and woman who love each other with passion and imagination and tenderness, there is something of inestimable value, to be ignorant of which is a great misfortune to any human being.'''
** [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[w:Marriage and Morals|Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929), Ch. 3: The Dominion of the Father

* '''Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse; it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives.'''
** [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[w:Marriage and Morals|Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929), Ch. 9: The Place of Love in Human Life

* Passionate mutual love while it lasts... breaks down the hard walls of the ego, producing a new being composed of two in one. '''Nature did not construct human beings to stand alone''', since they cannot fulfil her biological purpose except with the help of another; and '''civilized people cannot fully satisfy their sexual instinct without love'''... '''Those who have never known the deep intimacy and the intense companionship of happy mutual love have missed the best thing that life has to give'''; unconsciously, if not consciously, they feel this, and the resulting disappointment inclines them towards envy, oppression and cruelty. To give due place to passionate love should be therefore a matter which concerns the sociologist, since, if they miss this experience, men and women cannot attain their full stature, and cannot feel towards the rest of the world that kind of generous warmth without which their social activities are pretty sure to be harmful.
** [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[w:Marriage and Morals|Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929), Ch. 9: The Place of Love in Human Life

* '''To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead.'''
** [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[w:Marriage and Morals|Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929),Ch. 19: Sex and Individual Well-Being

* [T]he only sex relations that have real value are those in which there is no reticence and in which the whole personality of both becomes merged in a new collective personality. '''Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.'''
** [[Bertrand Russell]], ''The Conquest of Happiness'' (1930), Ch. 12: Affection

* I should like to say two things. One intellectual and one moral. The intellectual thing I should want to say to them is this: &quot;'''When you are studying any matter, or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only: What are the facts, and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted, either by what you wish to believe, or what you think could have beneficent social effects if it were believed; but look only and solely at what are the facts.'''&quot; That is the intellectual thing that I should wish to say. The moral thing I should wish to say to them is very simple; I should say: &quot;'''[[Love]] is wise – Hatred is foolish.'''&quot; In this world, which is getting more and more closely interconnected, we have to learn to tolerate each other. We have to learn to put up with the fact, that some people say things we don't like. We can only live together in that way. But if we are to live together, and not die together, we must learn a kind of charity and a kind of tolerance which is absolutely vital, to the continuation of human life on this planet.
** [[Bertrand Russell]], Response to the question &quot;Suppose Lord Russell, this film were to be looked at by our descendants, like a dead sea scroll in a thousand years time. What would you think it's worth telling that generation about the life you've lived and the lessons you've learned from it?&quot; in a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3aPkzHpT8M BBC interview on &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1959)].

* '''The good life is one inspired by love and guided by [[knowledge]].'''
** [[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[w:What I Believe|What I Believe]]'' (1925)

* At puberty, the elements of an unsuperstitious sexual morality ought to be taught. Boys and girls should be taught that nothing can justify sexual intercourse unless there is mutual inclination... Boys and girls should be taught respect for each other's liberty; they should be made to feel that nothing gives one human being rights over another, and that '''jealousy and possessiveness kill love'''. They should be taught that to bring another human being into the world is a very serious matter, only to be undertaken when the child will have a reasonable prospect of health, good surroundings, and parental care. But they should also be taught methods of birth control, so as to insure that children shall only come when they are wanted. Finally, they should be taught the dangers of venereal disease, and the methods of prevention and cure. The increase of human happiness to be expected from sex education on these lines is immeasurable.

* '''This pain, accompanied by the idea of our own weakness, is called ''humility''; the pleasure, which springs from the contemplation of ourselves, is called ''self-love'' or ''self-complacency''.'''  And inasmuch as this feeling is renewed as often as a man contemplates his own virtues, or his own power of activity, it follows that everyone is fond of narrating his own exploits, and displaying the force both of his body and his mind, and also that, for this reason, men are troublesome to one another. Again, it follows that men are naturally envious, rejoicing in the shortcomings of their equals, and feeling pain at their virtues. For '''whenever a man conceives his own actions, he is affected with pleasure, in proportion as his actions display more perfection, and he conceives them more distinctly--that is, in proportion as he can distinguish them from others, and regard them as something special. Therefore, a man will take pleasure in contemplating himself, when he contemplates some quality which he denies to others. But if that which he affirms of himself be attributable to the idea of man or animals in general, he will not be so greatly pleased: he will, on the contrary, feel pain, if he conceives that his own actions fall short when compared with those of others. This pain he will endeavor to remove, by putting a wrong construction on the actions of his equals, or by, as far as he can, embellishing his own. It is thus apparent that men are naturally prone to hatred and envy, which latter is fostered by their education.''' For parents are accustomed to incite their children to virtue solely by the spur of honor and envy, but perhaps, some will scruple to assent to what I have said, because we not seldom admire men's virtues, and venerate their possessors. In order to remove such doubts I append the following corollary.

* I have explained the causes of human infirmity and inconstancy, and shown why men do not abide by the precepts of reason. It now remains for me to show what course is marked out for us by reason, which of the emotions are in harmony with the rules of human reason, and which of them are contrary thereto. But, before I begin to prove my Propositions... it is advisable to sketch them briefly in advance... '''As reason makes no demands contrary to nature, it demands, that every man should love himself, should seek that which is useful to him... everything which really brings man to greater perfection... ''first'', that the foundation of virtue is the endeavor to preserve one's own being, and... happiness consists in man's power of preserving his own being; ''secondly'', that virtue is to be desired for its own sake, and that there is nothing more excellent or more useful to us... ''thirdly'' and lastly, that suicides are weak-minded, and are overcome by external causes repugnant to their nature. Further... we can never arrive at doing without all external things for the preservation of our being or living, so as to have no relations with things which are outside ourselves. ...our intellect would be more imperfect, if mind were alone, and could understand nothing besides itself.''' There are, then, many things outside ourselves, which are useful to us... none can be discerned more excellent, than those which are in entire agreement with our nature. ...if, for example, two individuals of entirely the same nature are united, they form a combination twice as powerful as either of them singly.  Therefore, '''to man there is nothing more useful than man—nothing, I repeat, more excellent for preserving their being can be wished for by men, than that all should so in all points agree, that the minds and bodies of all should form, as it were, one single mind and one single body, and that all should, with one consent, as far as they are able, endeavor to preserve their being, and all with one consent seek what is useful to them all. Hence, men who are governed by reason—that is, who seek what is useful to them in accordance with reason, desire for themselves nothing, which they do not also desire for the rest of mankind, and, consequently, are just, faithful, and honorable in their conduct.''' ...I have taken this course, in order, if possible, to gain the attention of those who believe, that the principle that every man is bound to seek what is useful for himself is the foundation of impiety, rather than of piety and virtue.

* '''He who lives according to the guidance of reason strives as much as possible to repay the hatred, anger, or contempt of others towards himself with love or generosity. ...hatred is increased by reciprocal hatred, and, on the other hand, can be extinguished by love, so that hatred passes into love.'''

* In so far as men are influenced by envy or any kind of hatred, one towards another, they are at variance, and are therefore to be feared in proportion, as they are more powerful than their fellows. &lt;br&gt; Yet '''minds are not conquered by force, but by love and high-mindedness.'''

* '''But love, I've come to understand, is more than three words mumbled before bedtime. Love is sustained by action, a pattern of devotion in the things we do for each other every day.'''
** [[Nicholas Sparks]] in ''[[w:The Wedding (Sparks novel)|The Wedding]]''

* In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man comes to die, no matter what his talents and influence and genius, if he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror.
** [[John Steinbeck]] in ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]''

* '''In every bit of honest writing in the world … there is a base theme. Try to understand men, if you understand each other you will be kind to each other. Knowing a man well never leads to hate and nearly always leads to love.''' There are shorter means, many of them. there is writing promoting social change, writing punishing injustice, writing in celebration of heroism, but always that base theme. '''Try to understand each other.'''
** [[John Steinbeck]] in ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', Journal entry (1938), quoted in the Introduction to a 1994 edition of ''Of Mice and Men'' by Susan Shillinglaw, p. vii

* Any man who talks about his love affairs thereby proves he is ignorant of love and is moved only by vanity.
** [[Stendhal]] in ''The Pink and the Green'' (''Le Rose et le Vert'', 1837), Ch. 9, translated by Richard Howard. London: Hamish Hamilton, 1988, p. 89

** [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], &quot;Lay Morals&quot; Ch. 4, in [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/373 ''Lay Morals and Other Essays'' (1911)].

* '''Falling in love is the one illogical adventure, the one thing of which we are tempted to think as supernatural, in our trite and reasonable world.''' The effect is out of all proportion with the cause. Two persons, neither of them, it may be, very amiable or very beautiful, meet, speak a little, and look a little into each other's eyes. That has been done a dozen or so of times in the experience of either with no great result. But on this occasion all is different. They fall at once into that state in which another person becomes to us the very gist and centrepoint of God's creation, and demolishes our laborious theories with a smile; in which our ideas are so bound up with the one master-thought that even the trivial cares of our own person become so many acts of devotion, and the love of life itself is translated into a wish to remain in the same world with so precious and desirable a fellow-creature.
** [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], ''Virginibus Puerisque'', Ch. 3.

* '''The cruelest lies are often told in silence.''' A man may have sat in a room for hours and not opened his teeth, and yet come out of that room a disloyal friend or a vile calumniator. And '''how many loves have perished because, from pride, or spite, or diffidence, or that unmanly shame which withholds a man from daring to betray emotion, a lover, at the critical point of the relation, has but hung his head and held his tongue?'''
** [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], ''Truth of Intercourse''.

* '''All who have meant good work with their whole hearts, have done good work, although they may die before they have the time to sign it. Every heart that has beat strong and cheerfully has left a hopeful impulse behind it in the world, and bettered the tradition of mankind.'''

* There are a great deal of a great many kinds of love.

* In the change of years, in the coil of things, &lt;br&gt; In the clamour and rumour of life to be, &lt;br&gt; '''We, drinking love at the furthest springs, &lt;br&gt; Covered with love as a covering tree, &lt;br&gt; We had grown as gods, as the gods above, &lt;br&gt; Filled from the heart to the lips with love, &lt;br&gt; Held fast in his hands, clothed warm with his wings, &lt;br&gt; O love, my love, had you loved but me!'''

* I had grown pure as the dawn and the dew, &lt;br&gt; You had grown strong as the sun or the sea. &lt;br&gt; But none shall triumph a whole life through: &lt;br&gt; For death is one, and the fates are three. &lt;br&gt; '''At the door of life, by the gate of breath, &lt;br&gt; There are worse things waiting for men than death; &lt;br&gt; Death could not sever my soul and you, &lt;br&gt; As these have severed your soul from me.''' &lt;p&gt; You have chosen and clung to the chance they sent you, &lt;br&gt; Life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer. &lt;br&gt; But will it not one day in heaven repent you? &lt;br&gt; Will they solace you wholly, the days that were? &lt;br&gt; '''Will you lift up your eyes between sadness and bliss, &lt;br&gt; Meet mine, and see where the great love is, &lt;br&gt; And tremble and turn and be changed?

* '''Let this be my last word, that I trust in thy love.'''
** [[Rabindranath Tagore]], Stray Birds (1916), 326

* '''Want of love is a degree of callousness; for love is the perfection of consciousness.''' We do not love because we do not comprehend, or rather we do not comprehend because we do not love. For '''love is the ultimate meaning of everything around us. It is not a mere sentiment; it is truth; it is the joy that is at the root of all creation.''' It is the white light of pure consciousness that emanates from Brahma. So, to be one with this ''sarvānubhūh'', this all-feeling being who is in the external sky, as well as in our inner soul, we must attain to that summit of consciousness, which is love: ''Who could have breathed or moved if the sky were not filled with joy, with love?''
** [[Rabindranath Tagore]], ''Sādhanā : The Realisation of Life'' (1916)

* '''Of course man is useful to man, because his body is a marvellous machine and his mind an organ of wonderful efficiency. But he is a spirit as well, and this spirit is truly known only by love.''' When we define a man by the market value of the service we can expect of him, we know him imperfectly. With this limited knowledge of him it becomes easy for us to be unjust to him and to entertain feelings of triumphant self-congratulation when, on account of some cruel advantage on our side, we can get out of him much more than we have paid for. But when we know him as a spirit we know him as our own. '''We at once feel that cruelty to him is cruelty to ourselves, to make him small is stealing from our own humanity...'''
** [[Rabindranath Tagore]], ''Sādhanā : The Realisation of Life'' (1916)

* '''We never can have a true view of man unless we have a love for him. Civilisation must be judged and prized, not by the amount of power it has developed, but by how much it has evolved and given expression to, by its laws and institutions, the love of humanity.''' The first question and the last which it has to answer is, Whether and how far it recognises man more as a spirit than a machine? Whenever some ancient civilisation fell into decay and died, it was owing to causes which produced callousness of heart and led to the cheapening of man's worth; when either the state or some powerful group of men began to look upon the people as a mere instrument of their power; when, by compelling weaker races to slavery and trying to keep them down by every means, man struck at the foundation of his greatness, his own love of freedom and fair-play. '''Civilisation can never sustain itself upon cannibalism of any form. For that by which alone man is true can only be nourished by love and justice.'''
** [[Rabindranath Tagore]], ''Sādhanā : The Realisation of Life'' (1916)

* '''In love all the contradictions of existence merge themselves and are lost. Only in love are unity and duality not at variance.''' Love must be one and two at the same time.&lt;br&gt; Only love is motion and rest in one. '''Our heart ever changes its place till it finds love, and then it has its rest. But this rest itself is an intense form of activity where utter quiescence and unceasing energy meet at the same point in love.'''&lt;br&gt; In love, loss and gain are harmonised. In its balance-sheet, credit and debit accounts are in the same column, and gifts are added to gains. In this wonderful festival of creation, this great ceremony of self-sacrifice of God, the lover constantly gives himself up to gain himself in love. Indeed, love is what brings together and inseparably connects both the act of abandoning and that of receiving.
** [[Rabindranath Tagore]], ''Sādhanā : The Realisation of Life'' (1916)

* '''In love, at one of its poles you find the personal, and at the other the impersonal. At one you have the positive assertion — Here I am; at the other the equally strong denial — I am not.''' Without this ego what is love? And again, with only this ego how can love be possible?&lt;br&gt; Bondage and liberation are not antagonistic in love. For love is most free and at the same time most bound. If God were absolutely free there would be no creation. '''The infinite being has assumed unto himself the mystery of finitude. And in him who is love the finite and the infinite are made one.'''
** [[Rabindranath Tagore]], ''Sādhanā : The Realisation of Life'' (1916)

* '''Compulsion is not indeed the final appeal to man, but joy is. And joy is everywhere'''; it is in the earth's green covering of grass; in the blue serenity of the sky; in the reckless exuberance of spring; in the severe abstinence of grey winter; in the living flesh that animates our bodily frame; in the perfect poise of the human figure, noble and upright; in living; in the exercise of all our powers; in the acquisition of knowledge; in fighting evils; in dying for gains we never can share. Joy is there everywhere; it is superfluous, unnecessary; nay, it very often contradicts the most peremptory behests of necessity. '''It exists to show that the bonds of law can only be explained by love; they are like body and soul. Joy is the realisation of the truth of oneness, the oneness of our soul with the world and of the world-soul with the supreme lover.'''

* Love's arms were wreathed about the neck of Hope,&lt;br&gt;And Hope kiss'd Love, and Love drew in her breath&lt;br&gt;In that close kiss and drank her whisper'd tales.&lt;br&gt;They said that Love would die when Hope was gone.&lt;br&gt;And Love mourn'd long, and sorrow'd after Hope;&lt;br&gt;At last she sought out Memory, and they trod&lt;br&gt;The same old paths where Love had walked with Hope,&lt;br&gt;And Memory fed the soul of Love with tears.

** [[Leo Tolstoy]], in [[s:A Letter to a Hindu|A Letter to a Hindu (1908)]]

* '''As soon as men live entirely in accord with the law of love natural to their hearts and now revealed to them, which excludes all resistance by violence, and therefore hold aloof from all participation in violence — as soon as this happens, not only will hundreds be unable to enslave millions, but not even millions will be able to enslave a single individual.'''
** [[Leo Tolstoy]] in &quot;A Letter to a Hindu&quot; (1908)

* The more God's manifestation in man (life) unites with the manifestations (lives) of other beings, the more man exists.

And when love is so great and so vital, so strong and so overflowing, that it loves everything, then it personalizes everything and discovers that the total All, that the Universe, is also a person possessing a Consciousness, a Consciousness which in its turn suffers, pities, and loves, and therefore is consciousness. '''And this Consciousness of the Universe, which a love, personalizing all that it loves, discovers, is what we call God.'''

* '''I think that everything that is really good and beautiful, the inner, moral, spiritual and sublime beauty in men and their works, comes from God, and everything that is bad and evil in the works of men and in men is not from God, and God does not approve of it. &lt;br&gt; But I cannot help thinking that the best way of knowing God is to love many things.

* The combination of these two facts — '''the longing in the depth of the heart for absolute good, and the power, though only latent, of directing attention and love to a reality beyond the world and of receiving good from it — constitutes a link which attaches every man without exception to that other reality.''' &lt;br&gt; '''Whoever recognizes that reality recognizes also that link. Because of it, he holds every human being without any exception as something sacred to which he is bound to show respect.''' &lt;br&gt; This is the only possible motive for universal respect towards all human beings. '''Whatever formulation of belief or disbelief a man may choose to make, if his heart inclines him to feel this respect, then he in fact also recognizes a reality other than this world's reality.''' Whoever in fact does not feel this respect is alien to that other reality also.
** [[Simone Weil]], ''Draft for a Statement of Human Obligation'' (1943)

* '''One of the most exquisite pleasures of [[human]] love — to serve the loved one without his knowing it — is only possible, as regards the love of [[God]], through [[atheism]].'''
** [[Simone Weil]], ''First and Last Notebooks'' (1970), Last Notebook (1942) p. 84

* '''If you say to someone who has ears to hear: &quot;What you are doing to me is not [[just]],&quot; you may touch and awaken at its source the [[spirit]] of attention and [[love]]. But it is not the same with [[words]] like, &quot;I have the [[right]]...&quot; or &quot;you have no right to...&quot; They evoke a latent [[war]] and awaken the spirit of contention.'''
** [[Simone Weil]], Human Personality (1943), Written ''c''. 1933; published in ''Selected Essays 1934-1943'', p. 63

* '''He who does not realize to what extent shifting [[fortune]] and [[necessity]] hold in subjection every [[human]] spirit, cannot regard as fellow-creatures nor [[love]] as he loves himself those whom chance separated from him by an abyss. '''The variety of constraints pressing upon man give rise to the illusion of several distinct species that cannot communicate. '''Only he who has measured the dominion of force, and knows how not to respect it, is capable of [[love]] and [[justice]].'''
** [[Simone Weil]], The ''Iliad'' or The Poem of Force (1940-1941), p. 192

* '''Love is a minefield.''' You take a step and get blown to pieces, put yourself back together again and stupidly take another step. I guess that's human nature. It hurts so much to be alone that we'd all rather blow up than be single.
** Kate Welles ([[w:Famke Janssen|Famke Janssen]]) in ''Love &amp; Sex'' (2000).

* '''I observed, &quot;Love is the fulfilling of the law, the end of the commandment.&quot; It is not only &quot;the first and great&quot; command, but all the commandments in one. &quot;Whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise,&quot; they are all comprised in this one word, ''love''.'''

* * '''Blow again trumpeter! and for thy theme,&lt;br&gt;Take now the enclosing theme of all, the solvent and the setting,&lt;br&gt;Love, that is pulse of all, the sustenance and the pang,&lt;br&gt;The heart of man and woman all for love,&lt;br&gt;No other theme but love — knitting, enclosing, all-diffusing love.'''
** [[Walt Whitman]] in [[Leaves of Grass]], The Mystic Trumpeter

* '''Love, that is all the earth to lovers — love, that mocks time and space,&lt;br&gt;Love, that is day and night — love, that is sun and moon and stars,&lt;br&gt;Love, that is crimson, sumptuous, sick with perfume,&lt;br&gt;No other words but words of love, no other thought but love.'''

* Be happy, be happy; you shall have your red rose. I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's-blood. All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.

** [[Oscar Wilde]], [[The Picture of Dorian Gray]], ch. 1

* When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.

* '''To be in love is to surpass one's self.'''
** [[Oscar Wilde]], [[The Picture of Dorian Gray]], ch. 5

* Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art. Besides, '''each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.'''

* A long time ago, Anne used to talk about energy—how that was all that love was—ions connecting across synapses of time and air. Don't rationalize, she'd say. None of it will ever make sense. I leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes, not wanting to cry. Anne was right. None of it made any sense.

My heart... It feels like my chest can barely contain it. Like it doesn't belong to me any more. It belongs to you.
